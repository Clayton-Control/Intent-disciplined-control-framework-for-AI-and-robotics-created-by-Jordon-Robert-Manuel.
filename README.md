# Clayton: Intent-Disciplined Control for AI and Robotics

Clayton is a rhythm-aware control framework that helps intelligent systems behave with patience, trust, and timing.

It was created by Jordon Robert Manuel â€” a crane operator, not a computer scientist â€” who discovered, through six hours of real-world consequence, that machines can be guided not by optimization, but by the shape of perfect motion.

Clayton doesn't chase reward. It doesn't correct on every deviation. It waits. It watches. And it speaks only when the world is ready to listen.

This model is freely given.

If you are using Clayton in critical, safety-sensitive, or scaled commercial systems â€” robotics, automation, production software â€” please contact:
